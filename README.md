### Advanced Mode (with ML Training)

#### Basic ML Training (Emotion Dataset Only)
1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `python setup.py` to install requirements and train the model
2. **Start API Server** (Optional): Run `python api_server.py` for real-time ML predictions
3. **Use Enhanced Chatbot**: The chatbot will now use ML-trained keywords for better stress detection
4. **API Integration**: Enable ML API by setting `window.useMLAPI = true` and `window.mlAPIEndpoint = 'http://localhost:5000'` in browser console

#### Enhanced ML Training (with Local Dataset)
1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `python enhanced_setup.py --mode enhanced` to train with your local dataset
2. **Start Enhanced API Server** (Optional): Run `python enhanced_api_server.py` for enhanced ML predictions
3. **Use Enhanced Chatbot**: The chatbot will use both emotion dataset and your local dataset for better accuracy
4. **API Integration**: Enable enhanced ML API by setting `window.useMLAPI = true` and `window.mlAPIEndpoint = 'http://localhost:5001'` in browser console

#### Training Modes
- `python enhanced_setup.py --mode basic` - Train only with emotion dataset
- `python enhanced_setup.py --mode enhanced` - Train with your local dataset + emotion dataset
- `python enhanced_setup.py --mode both` - Train both models (default)
- `python enhanced_setup.py --local-dataset-path "your/path"` - Specify custom dataset path
